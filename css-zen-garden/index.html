            <intro>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</intro>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMS, broken
                <u>CSS</u> support, and abandoned browsers.
            </p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
                folk like the W3C, WASP and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>The <u>CSS</u> Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.
                Begin to
                see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
                with the web.</p>
            <br>
            <intro>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</intro>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <u>CSS</u>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
                encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one
                will load the style sheet into this very page, The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has
                changed is the external <u>CSS</u> file. Yes, really.</p>
            <p><u>CSS</u> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this
                can be
                ilustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins
                are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
                contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

            <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <u>CSS</u>
                skills
                are
                necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <u>CSS</u> novices can
                use them
                as
                starting points. Please see the <u>CSS</u> Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on
                working
                with <u>CSS</u>.
            </p>
            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <u>HTML</u>. This may seem
                daunting at
                first if
                you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the
                sample files
                as a guide.</p>
            <p>Download the sample <a class='main2a' href='url'>HTML</a> and <a class='main2a' href='url'>CSS</a> to
                work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished
                work) upload your <u>CSS</u> file to a web server under your
                control.
                <a class='main2a' href='url'>Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets,

            <intro>REQUIREMENTS</intro>
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <u>CSS 1 & 2</u> usage. <u>CSS 3 & 4</u> should be limited to
                widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The <u>CSS</u> Zen Garden is
                about
                functional, practical <u>CSS</u> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% or the browsing
                public.
                The only real requirement we have is that your <u>CSS</u> validates.</p>
            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <u>CSS</u> by now. When
                sticking to
                the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer
                number of user agents on the web these days - especially when you factor in mobile - pixel-perfect
                layouts may not be possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your
                design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by
                over 90% or the population).</p>
            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're
                well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
            <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
                limited exceptions, see <a class='main3a' href='url'>submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release
                your <u>CSS</u>
                under a Creative
                Commons
                license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
