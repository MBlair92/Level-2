        <h2>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT </h2>
        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
            <br>incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
            <br>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
            <br>thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser
            <br>creators.
            <br>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
            <br>lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored
            <br>techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.
        </p>
        <h2>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h2>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, 
            <br>inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
            <br>Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The  HTML remains  
            <br>the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file.
            <br>Yes, really.
            <br>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
            <br>illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in
            <br>the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the
            <br>beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

        <h2>PARTICIPATION</h2>
        <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too,
            <br>but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see
            <br>the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
            <br>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve
            <br>never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
            <br>Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and
            <br>please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to
            <br>an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our
            <br>server.
        <h2>BENEFITS</h2>
        <P>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing CSS
            <br>really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those
            <br>who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.

        <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
        <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
            <br>lements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS 
            <br>and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we
            <br>have is that your CSS validates.
            <br>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to
            <br>the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number
            <br>of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be
            <br>possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at
            <br>least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
            <br>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a
            <br>minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point
            <br>of needing another garden-related design.
            <br>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited
            <br>exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license
            <br>identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.
